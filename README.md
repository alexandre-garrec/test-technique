# Cajoo Developer Test

We would like to thank you for taking our developer test. We understand that candidates will often have many of these tests to complete, therefore we think it's important to cut straight to the important stuff.

## About this repository

We've gone ahead and created a boilerplate that represents part of the technical stack we work with. It contains the following:

- A React app in Typescript (created with `create-react-app`)
- An Apollo client configured with credentials to connect to a staging environment with mock data
- Some GraphQL queries to fetch data and examples of how it can be used

## Context

## Challenge

_Display summary information for a customer as if you were a member of the customer service team_

#### Your challenge is to clone this repository and create a small web application to visualize the users information, so that looking at it is valuable to a member of the customer service team

How you do that is up to you - feel free to make up your own mind and get challenged by the interviewer before starting to write any code.

## Deliverables

- Put your code on Github and send us the link to the repository

## Usage

Start the React app

a. Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

b. Run the application (will start on port `3000`)

```bash
yarn start
```
